# Weather App

## About 💭
A weather app using which user can find weather condition of different locations and request weather of the live location. This web app requests thrid party API for weather of a location, and displays the data in a clean UI. I have used Javascript's Geolocation API for accessing user's current location.

## Running on local machine🏃‍♀️
The app is made using React.

```
# install all dependencies
npm install

# run the react app
npm start
```
